# Yuck

Yuck is a constraint solver based on local search.

Yuck currently implements simulated annealing.

Yuck currently supports boolean, integer, and integer set variables.

Yuck can be used as a library or as a [FlatZinc](http://www.minizinc.org/downloads/doc-1.6/flatzinc-spec.pdf) interpreter.

Yuck can be used as backend for the [MiniZinc IDE](http://www.minizinc.org/ide/index.html).

Yuck is written in Scala and exploits the Scala library's immutable collection classes for implementing global constraints.

Yuck will become available as open source on Github later this year.
