# Yuck

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/informarte/yuck.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/informarte/yuck)

## What is Yuck?

* Yuck is a constraint solver powered by local search.
* Yuck's approach to problem solving is comparable to Comet [HM05] and [OscaR](http://oscarlib.bitbucket.org)/CBLS [BMFP15].
* Yuck can be used as a library or as a [FlatZinc](http://www.minizinc.org/downloads/doc-1.6/flatzinc-spec.pdf) interpreter that integrates with the [MiniZinc toolchain](http://www.minizinc.org/software).
* Yuck is provided under the terms of the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0).
* Yuck's design goal is not to compete with highly tuned LP, CP, or SAT solvers, but to provide an alternative for cases where the use of such solvers is inappropriate or seems risky, namely when the input data might be inconsistent with the constraints (so the solver is expected to build around what is given), or when the requirements are hard to model and it seems easier to provide domain-specific constraints for local search than for tree search.
* Yuck is written in Scala and exploits the Scala library's immutable collection classes for implementing global constraints.

## Current state

* Yuck implements simulated annealing along with some basic annealing schedules and some schedule combinators.
* Yuck supports lexicographic cost functions with both minimization and maximization goals.
* Yuck allows to timebox and parallelize solvers by means of solver combinators.
* Yuck supports the interruption and the resumption of solvers to facilitate the presentation of intermediate results.
* Yuck implements boolean, integer, and integer set variables.
* Yuck supports implicit solving by means of constraint-specific neighbourhoods.
* Yuck's constraint library is far from complete but already provides the most frequently used constraints.
* Yuck's FlatZinc frontend supports most of FlatZinc and many global MiniZinc constraints, see [FlatZinc support](#flatzinc-support).
* Yuck is developer-friendly and easy to extend, see [Contributing](#contributing).
* Yuck was submitted to the [2016 MiniZinc challenge](http://www.minizinc.org/challenge2016/challenge.html) where it coped quite well with 12 out of 20 problems.
* In the [2017 MiniZinc challenge](http://www.minizinc.org/challenge2017/challenge.html), Yuck ranked second among local-search solvers.

## FlatZinc support

Yuck's FlatZinc frontend supports all of FlatZinc except for float variables and float constraints.

Yuck provides dedicated solvers for the following global MiniZinc constraints:

* all_different, all_different_except_0
* at_least, at_most
* bin_packing, bin_packing_capa, bin_packing_load
* count_eq, count_geq, count_gt, count_leq, count_lt, count_neq
* cumulative
* disjunctive
* exactly
* global_cardinality and friends
* inverse
* lex_less, lex_lesseq
* maximum
* member
* minimum
* nvalue
* regular
* table

Yuck provides dedicated neighbourhoods for the following global MiniZinc constraints:

* all_different
* inverse

When used as a FlatZinc interpreter, Yuck proceeds as follows:

* It performs a limited amount of constraint propagation to reduce variable domains before starting local search.
* It eliminates variables by exploiting equality constraints.
* It identifies and exploits functional dependencies to reduce the number of decision variables.
* It uses an annealing schedule that interleaves adaptive cooling with geometric reheating.
* In move generation, it concentrates on variables that are involved in constraint violations.
* It uses restarting to increase robustness: When a solver terminates without having reached its objective, it gets replaced by a new one starting out from another random assignment.
* When Yuck is configured to use multiple threads, restarting turns into parallel solving: Given a thread pool and a stream of solvers with a common objective, Yuck submits the solvers to the thread pool and, when one of the solvers provides a solution that satisfies the objective, Yuck discards all running and pending solvers.

## Download and installation

Yuck downloads are available from the [Releases page](https://github.com/informarte/yuck/releases).

After downloading the package, proceed as follows:

1. Make sure that a [Java runtime environment](https://openjdk.java.net/install) is available on your system; Yuck requires at least version 8.
2. Unzip the package in a suitable location.
3. To register Yuck as a backend for the MiniZinc toolchain, define the ```MZN_SOLVER_PATH``` environment variable to point to the ```mzn``` subfolder of the Yuck distribution. (For other ways of providing a solver configuration file to the MiniZinc toolchain, see the section on [Solver Configuration Files](http://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.2.0/en/fzn-spec.html#solver-configuration-files) of *The MiniZinc Handbook*.)

## Usage as MiniZinc backend

To apply Yuck to MiniZinc models, you need a working [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/software.html) installation. This section assumes that you have at least version 2.2.2 installed and that Yuck has been properly registered as a MiniZinc backend (see above).

To use Yuck from inside the MiniZinc IDE, just select it from the menu of solver configurations before running your model.

To run MiniZinc models from the command line, use `minizinc` as follows:

```
minizinc --solver yuck zebra.mzn

zebra:
nation = [3, 4, 2, 1, 5]
colour = [3, 5, 4, 1, 2]
animal = [4, 1, 2, 5, 3]
drink  = [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]
smoke  = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
----------
```

## Direct usage

To use Yuck directly, invoke it with the FlatZinc file on the command line, for example:

```
yuck zebra.fzn

animal = array1d(0..4, [4, 1, 2, 5, 3]);
colour = array1d(0..4, [3, 5, 4, 1, 2]);
drink = array1d(0..4, [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]);
nation = array1d(0..4, [3, 4, 2, 1, 5]);
smoke = array1d(0..4, [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]);
----------
```

Yuck's output complies to the requirements of the [FlatZinc 1.6 specification](http://www.minizinc.org/downloads/doc-1.6/flatzinc-spec.pdf) (see section 6).

Use the `--help` option to obtain a list of all options.

In case you need Yuck's MiniZinc library: it resides in the `mzn/lib` subfolder of the Yuck distribution.

## Future work

* Allow for the composition of lexicographic cost functions in
  MiniZinc through constraint and goal annotations
* Implement among, diffn, circuit, subcircuit, ...
* Provide soft constraints
* Refactor and improve up-front propagation
* Reduce dependence on integration testing by adding more unit tests

## Contributing

Yuck is developer-friendly:

* It's source code is clean and well-documented.
* It provides extensive and configurable logging.
* Test coverage is good.

Yuck is easy to extend:

* It's core machinery can be asked to look for misbehaving constraints while running a solver.
* New variable types can be added without touching the core machinery and without impairing the type safety of the system.

To build and run Yuck, you need [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org).

Use `sbt eclipse` to create an Eclipse project.

### Building

To build and rebuild Yuck and its documentation, use the sbt standard targets:

* `sbt compile` compiles all sources that need compilation.
* `sbt doc` creates the ScalaDoc documentation from the sources.
* `sbt clean` removes all artifacts of compiling and building.

### Testing

Yuck tests are based on [JUnit 4](http://junit.org/junit4/) and
[MiniZinc 2.2.x](http://www.minizinc.org/software.html).

* `make unit-tests` builds and runs all unit tests.
* `make minizinc-tests` runs all FlatZinc frontend tests.
* `make minizinc-examples` exercises Yuck on a subset of the MiniZinc 1.6 examples.
* `make ci-tests` runs all these tests.

FlatZinc generation is fully automated and happens on the fly.

All test cases other than unit tests leave a log in the local ```tmp```
folder.

Optimization results undergo automated verification using Gecode (part of the MiniZinc distribution).

### Running

There are two ways to run Yuck:

* Stage and run it:

  ```
   sbt stage
   ./bin/yuck --help
   ```

* Run it through sbt:

  ```
  sbt run --help
  ```

### Coding style

Yuck code should follow the [Scala Style
Guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/) with two exceptions:

  * Indentation should be four instead of two spaces.
  * Method calls should always be chained with the dot operator, so don't use infix notation.

In addition, the following rules apply:

  * Lines should not be much longer than 120 characters.
  * Don't give a result type when overriding a definition.
