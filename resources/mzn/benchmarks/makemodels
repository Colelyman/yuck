# This script generates FlatZinc models for a whole benchmark suite.
# The benchmark suite is expected to reside in a folder called 'problems'
# and the script expects invocation in the parent of this folder.
# The suite folder is expected to contain a folder for each problem.
# For problems without MiniZinc data files, the MiniZinc model files may be
# organized into sub-folders.
# For problems with MiniZinc data files, the data files may be organized
# into sub-folders but the MiniZinc model files are expected to reside
# on top level.
# The script will generate a folder called 'models' the structure of which
# will reflect the structure of the suite, i.e. there will be folder for
# each problem, and so on.
# For problems with MiniZinc data files, there will a folder for each
# MiniZinc model, even when there is only one MiniZinc model. (This way
# the folder structure does not depend on the number of MiniZinc models
# and adding or deleting MiniZinc models will not change the folder
# structure.)
