/**
 * Customizable factory for creating a neighbourhood for the problem at hand.
 *
 * The default implementation creates a [[yuck.core.RandomReassignmentGenerator
 * RandomReassignmentGenerator]] instance on the involved search variables.
 * This behaviour can be customized via three hooks:
 * createNeighbourhoodFor{Satisfaction, Minimization, Maximization}Goal.
 *
 * In case we end up with two neighbourhoods (one for the satisfaction goal and another
 * for the optimization goal), these neighbourhoods will be stacked by creating an instance
 * of [[yuck.core.NeighbourhoodCollection NeighbourhoodCollection]] instrumented to
 * focus on the satisfaction goal in case hard constraints are violated. To this end,
 * we keep track of goal satisfaction by means of a dynamic distribution (maintained by
 * an instance of [[yuck.constraints.DistributionMaintainer DistributionMaintainer]]).
