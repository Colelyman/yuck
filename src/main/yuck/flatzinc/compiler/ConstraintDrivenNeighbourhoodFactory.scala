/**
 * Generates focused neighbourhoods for satisfaction and minimization goals.
 *
 * The generation is driven by the constraints that contribute to the goal: For each one,
 * a neighbourhood is created. The resulting neighbourhoods are collected and
 * wrapped up in an instance of [[yuck.core.NeighbourhoodCollection NeighbourhoodCollection]]
 * such that the process of move generation will comprise two steps: First some move
 * neighbourhood will be chosen and second the chosen neighbourhood will be asked to provide a move.

 * To focus the search on violated constraints, we keep track of (weighted) constraint
 * violations by means of a dynamic distribution (maintained by an instance of
 * [[yuck.constraints.DistributionMaintainer DistributionMaintainer]]) for use in the
 * first step of move generation.
 *
 * Candidates for implicit solving are handled with priority to avoid that their variables
 * get included into other neighbourhoods. (In case two candidates for implicit solving
 * compete for a variable, this conflict is resolved by random choice.) This special
 * treatment is implemented using laziness to a certain extent: The procedure creates a
 * factory that already contains the neighbourhoods for implicit constraints while the
 * remaining neighbourhoods get generated on demand.
