/**
 * Turns the given collection of neighbourhoods into a neighbourhood.
 *
 * To generate a move, one of the neighbourhoods is chosen and asked for a move.
 *
 * Neighbourhood selection can happen in two ways:
 * In fair mode, all neighbourhoods are equally likely to get chosen while
 * in unfair mode the selection probability may be skewed in some way.
 *
 * To facilitate unfair choice, a so-called hot-spot distribution has to be given.
 *
 * With unfair choice enabled, the probability of fair choice comes into play.
 *
 * The implementation of fair neighbourhood selection is based on the neighbourhood sizes:
 * The probability of choosing a neighbourhood is proportional to the number of its
 * search variables.
 *
 * Falls back to fair mode when the given hot-spot distribution has zero volume.
