     *
     * Tightening only applies when the underlying objective variable x is a search
     * variable not constrained implicitly.
     *
     * The first step of tightening is to find the best objective value a that is compatible
     * with the current search state (in the sense that its assignment to x does not impair
     * the solution quality), to assign a to x, and to prune all values worse than a from
     * the domain of x.
     *
     * The second step of tightening is to reduce the domain of x in accordance with the
     * purpose of this method (unless this step would wipe out the domain of x) and includes,
     * as a prerequisite, assigning to x the worst value of the reduced domain.
     *
     * The result of this method is twofold:
     * 1. The search state resulting from the first step.
     *    (This may be the search state of the given space.)
     * 2. Some(x) if the domain of x was reduced in the process, and None otherwise.
